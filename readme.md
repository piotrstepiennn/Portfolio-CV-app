You can check out application by following link [PiotrStepien.online](https://piotrstepien.online/) 

The application serves as a minimalist portfolio/CV. The application is configured using CI/CD techniques.
The main goal of its creation, besides presenting myself, was the hands-on configuration of the technology
used in CI/CD process. This allowed for automated testing, building, creating a Docker image, and
deploying the application image to an Azure virtual machine after each push commit to GitHub. The
application currently operates on Azure Service App due to the excessively high costs of maintaining the
infrastructure I used during CI/CD. The technologies used for developing the application and CI/CD are
listed below.

Technologies:  
Frontend: Reactjs, Typescript  
CI/CD: Github, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Azure
